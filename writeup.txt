To predict whether a user would read a given book, the solution leverages a hybrid approach combining Jaccard similarity with popularity-based thresholds. First, a dictionary is constructed to store the sets of users who have interacted with each book. Jaccard similarity is then calculated to measure the overlap between users who have read the current book and users who have read other books in the user’s history. The hybrid prediction model first checks if the Jaccard similarity exceeds a predetermined threshold (using a separate iterative technique) of 5%. If it does, the book is predicted as “read”. If not, the model defaults to a popularity-based method, which prioritizes the top 70% most-read books among all users. This method ensures that the prediction balances personalized recommendations (Jaccard similarity) with general popularity trends.The task of predicting star ratings for each user-item pair was approached using a bias-based collaborative filtering model. The solutions initializes global averages, user biases, and item biases, which are iteratively updated using gradient descent. Regularization is also applied (using a lambda term that was predetermined to perform the best on the validation set, using a separate iteration technique) to prevent overfitting. The final prediction for a user-item pair combines the global average, the specific user’s bias, and the specific item’s bias. This method effectively captures both individual user tendencies and item-specific popularity. The model iterates until convergence or until a maximum number of iterations is reached.
